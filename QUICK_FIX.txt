QUICK FIX FOR RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT
=================================

The issue: Assets (JS/CSS) are returning 404 errors due to cached builds.

IMMEDIATE STEPS:
================

1. In Railway Dashboard → Your Service → Variables tab:
   Add or update these variables:
   
   APP_URL=https://ingrentilicious-production.up.railway.app
   ASSET_URL=https://ingrentilicious-production.up.railway.app
   
2. In Railway Dashboard → Settings → Danger Zone:
   Click "Remove All Volumes" to clear cache
   
3. Push your code to trigger a fresh deployment:
   
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment"
   git push
   
4. Wait for deployment to complete and check the logs for:
   ✓ "npm run build" success
   ✓ "vite build" completion
   ✓ No errors

5. Test your site:
   - Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
   - Visit your Railway URL
   - Check browser console for errors

WHAT WAS FIXED:
===============
✓ CORS middleware configured
✓ CORS headers in .htaccess
✓ Asset URL forcing in AppServiceProvider
✓ Build cache clearing in nixpacks.toml
