REQUIRED RAILWAY ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
======================================

Add these variables in Railway Dashboard → Your Service → Variables tab:

1. APP_URL=https://ingrentilicious-production.up.railway.app
2. ASSET_URL=https://ingrentilicious-production.up.railway.app
3. SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true
4. SESSION_DOMAIN=.ingrentilicious-production.up.railway.app
5. SESSION_SAME_SITE=lax

WHY THESE ARE NEEDED:
=====================

SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true
- Forces cookies to only be sent over HTTPS
- Required for Railway's HTTPS deployment

SESSION_DOMAIN=.ingrentilicious-production.up.railway.app
- Ensures cookies work across your domain
- The leading dot (.) allows subdomains

SESSION_SAME_SITE=lax
- Allows cookies to be sent on redirects
- Fixes the "Not Found" error after login/signup

STEPS TO FIX:
=============

1. Go to Railway Dashboard
2. Select your Ingrentlicious service
3. Click "Variables" tab
4. Add each variable above
5. Click "Deploy" to redeploy

After deployment, test:
- Register a new account
- Login with existing account
- Both should redirect to /dashboard successfully
